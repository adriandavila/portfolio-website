General:
- Reposition side socials & email further in from sides (reference Brit website for numbers)
- Some quick animation on website load?
- future goal: create themes (bright & airy, nature, neon, etc...)
- make sure socials aren't squished at bottom on mobile
- bug: hamburger menu not showing on mobile (has to do with style && color // background color I believe)

Home/Hero:
- Fix navbar when resizing page - in particular, change the breakpoints
- Create new background SVG & change background
- Fix hero text positioning & styling
- New logo & update in navbar
- Link to resume (change in nav)
- Animations on navbar upon website load
- Use JS to disable animation when resizing page?
